1) setImmediate puts the callback in the check queue while setTimeout outs the callback in the timers queue. The timers queue has higher priority than the check queue which will make whatever in the timers queue execute first
2) process.nextTick does not put the callback in any of the event loop queue, instead it gives it very high pririoty & this procss executes before any other callback. The setImmediate just puts the callback in the check queue
3) fs, util, http, https, os, path, buffer, crypto, cluster, stream
